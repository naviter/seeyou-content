Here is some **markdown**. *So easy* to write {{frontMatter.layout}}.
You can interpolate JS expressions like
or.

You can also interpolate JSX elements,
whether {{ <span>inline</span> }} or as a block:

{{ <div className="fancy-class">
  This is a block.
</div> }}

You can even break up JSX interpolation to process more or your text

{{ <div className="fancy-class"> }}
  This is a **Markdown** paragraph inside the div.

{{ </div> }}
